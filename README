= VimTree

VIM Filesystem Tree plugin in Ruby.

Less than 500 lines of unit-tested, readable code. Yes, VIM plugins *can* be
slick & sexy.


Currently in the middle of a rewrite. The following might be outdated or
currently not working.


== Requirements

VIM Ruby support

== Installation

Copy or link vim_tree* to ~/.vim/plugin (i.e. both the vim_tree directory and
the vim_tree.vim plugin file).

== Usage

This will open the tree window:

  :VimTree

If you provide a path as an argument (you can use auto-completition here) then
VimTree will set the current working directory to that path and open with it
as a root path:

  :VimTree ~/Development/vim/vim_tree

The following keys work in the tree window:

  h, crsr-left   - close directory (if closed, closes the parent directory)
  l, crsr-right  - open directory (and move into it) or file
  H, shift-left  - recursively open directory
  L, shift-right - recursively close directory
  k, crsr-up     - navigate up
  j, crsr-down   - navigate down
  K, shift-up    - navigate to first sibling
  J, shift-down  - navigate to last sibling
  cr (enter)     - toggle (open/close) directory or open file
  left-click     - toggle (open/close) directory or open file
  s              - open a file with split
  v              - open a file with vsplit
  u              - move out (move the tree's root directory one level up)
  i              - move into (make the current directory the tree's root directory)
  C              - change current working directory to root directory
  c              - change current working directory to selected directory
  T              - focus tree window
  R              - refresh
  Q              - quit

The following groups are matched for highlighting (styling) the tree window.

  vimTree              - the whole tree window *
  vimDir               - any directory *
  vimDirOpen           - an open directory
  vimDirClosed         - a closed directory
  vimDirHandle         - the handle of any directory *
  vimDirHandleOpen     - an open directory handle
  vimDirHandleClosed   - a closed directory handle
  vimBufferLoaded      - a file that is loaded in any buffer
  vimDot               - marker for loaded files (hidden by default)

*) doesn't currently work. can you fix them?

== Todo

- map m to: minimize tree window
- figure out how to have a vim_tree filetype and syntax in order to hide the
  cursor locally in the vim_tree window
- figure out how to map cmd-click to just activating the window
  instead of opening the node
- extract config options
