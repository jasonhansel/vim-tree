= FsTree

VIM Filesystem Tree plugin in Ruby.

Very early alpha but already (somewhat) usable.

== Requirements

VIM Ruby support

== Installation

Copy or link fs_tree* to ~/.vim/plugin (i.e. both the fs_tree directory and the
fs_tree.vim plugin file).

== Usage

:FsTree will open the tree menu.

crsr-left  - close directory (if closed, closes the parent directory)
crsr-right - open directory (and move into it) or file
crsr-up    - navigate up
crsr-down  - navigate down
cr (enter) - toggle (open/close) directory or open file
left-click - toggle (open/close) directory or open file
s          - open a file with split
v          - open a file with vsplit
J          - make a directory the root directory
K          - move the root directory one level up
R          - refresh (currently looses open directory information)

== Todo

- maintain open directory information on refresh
- map C to: change current working directory to root directory
- map c to: change current working directory to selected directory
- map K to: go to first sibling in directory
- map J to: go to last sibling in directory
- map H to: recursively close all nodes below current one
- map L to: recursively open all nodes under current one
- map q to: quit tree window
- map m to: minimize tree window
- figure out how to delete the last line in the tree buffer
- figure out how to map cmd-click to just activating the window
  instead of opening the node
- extract config options
