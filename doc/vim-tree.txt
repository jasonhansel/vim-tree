INTRODUCTION                                          *vim-tree*

vim-tree is a VIM filesystem tree plugin in less than 500 lines of unit-
tested, readable code.


USAGE                                                 *vim-tree-usage*

This will open the tree window:

  :VimTree

If you provide a path as an argument then vim-tree will set the current
working directory to that path and open the tree window with it as a root
path:

  :VimTree ~/Development/vim/vim_tree

The following keys work in the tree window:

  h, <Left>    - close directory (if closed, closes the parent directory)
  l, <Right>   - open directory (and move into it) or file
  H, <S-Left>  - recursively open directory
  L, <S-Right> - recursively close directory
  k, <Up>      - navigate up
  j, <Down>    - navigate down
  K, <S-Up>    - navigate to first sibling
  J, <S-Down>  - navigate to last sibling
  cr (enter)   - toggle (open/close) directory or open file
  left-click   - toggle (open/close) directory or open file
  s            - open a file with split
  v            - open a file with vsplit
  u            - move out (move the tree's root directory one level up)
  i            - move into (current directory becomes the tree's root dir)
  C            - change current working directory to root directory
  c            - change current working directory to selected directory
  T            - focus tree window
  R            - refresh


HIGHLIGHTING                                          *vim-tree-highlighting*

The following groups are matched for highlighting (styling) the tree window.

  vimTree              - the whole tree window *
  vimDir               - any directory *
  vimDirOpen           - an open directory
  vimDirClosed         - a closed directory
  vimDirHandle         - the handle of any directory *
  vimDirHandleOpen     - an open directory handle
  vimDirHandleClosed   - a closed directory handle
  vimBufferLoaded      - a file that is loaded in any buffer
  vimDot               - marker for loaded files (hidden by default)

*) doesn't currently work. can you fix them?
